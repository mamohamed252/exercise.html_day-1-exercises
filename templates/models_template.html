        <p>
                In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements. <strong>Block
                        level</strong> elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while inline
                level elements typically appear within the flow of text content.
        </p>

        <!-- Used paragraph tag to wrap text -->
        <!-- Used strong tag to bold text -->
        <p>In this example the <strong>heading 1 </strong>and the <stong>paragraphs</stong> are block level items, while
                the bold tags and the link
                below are examples of inline level elements.
        </p>
        <!-- Used paragraph tag to wrap text -->
        <!-- Used strong tag to bold text -->
        <!-- Used href to hyperlink image and target to open blank tap with image -->
        <!-- Updated hyperlink to previous edited body-template html -->
        <p>In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML.
                There are seven main models: <strong>Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and
                        Sectioning</strong>.
